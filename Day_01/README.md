### Finished Chapter 1: **Why CUDA? Why Now?**

##### _Summary of the chapter_:
In this chapter, the authors explored the fascinating journey of parallel processing, from its humble beginnings with dual-core processors to todayâ€™s multi-core CPUs (8-core, 16-core, 32-core, and beyond). They highlighted how the clock speeds of CPUs have dramatically evolvedâ€”from 1 MHz in the 1980s to 4 GHz today, achieving speeds nearly 1,000 times faster than early personal computers.

However, as computational tasks like tumor detection or molecular simulations became increasingly complex, CPUs alone struggled to handle the workload. This challenge gave rise to GPU computing and the advent of CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), which revolutionized how GPUs were used.

Initially, GPUs were designed strictly for graphics-intensive tasks, and programming them required converting projects into graphics-oriented code using languages like OpenGL, GLSL, or Microsoft HLSL. CUDA, introduced by NVIDIA, changed this paradigm by allowing developers to program GPUs directly using CUDA C, a language built on C/C++ but enhanced with GPU-specific functionalities.

The authors also discussed real-world applications that demonstrated CUDA's transformative potential:

- Medical Imaging: CUDA enabled early breast cancer diagnosis, significantly speeding up and improving computational efficiency.
- Fluid Dynamics: Researchers at the University of Cambridge used CUDA to replace massive supercomputers with just 2-3 GPUs for fluid simulations, achieving higher efficiency.
- Environmental Science: CUDA-powered GPUs helped simulate the molecular structure of surfactants in detergents and shampoos, aiding advancements in material science.

This chapter emphasized the significance of CUDA in democratizing high-performance computing, showcasing how GPUs became instrumental in solving problems previously thought to require supercomputers.
