## Summary of Day 27:

> *Starting from 10.3 ‚Äî A simple sum reduction kernel

#### Simple Sum Reduction Kernel

***How It Works:***
- Threads are assigned to even indices of the input array:

    - Thread 0 ‚Üí Input, Thread 1 ‚Üí Input[2], Thread 2 ‚Üí Input[4], etc.

- The kernel operates as a reduction tree:

    - In each iteration, active threads add elements at a distance defined by the `stride` variable.

    - The `stride` starts at 1 and doubles each iteration (`stride *= 2`).

- Fewer threads participate in each iteration:

    - For example, in the second iteration, only threads with indices divisible by 2 remain active.

- Thread 0 writes the final sum to the output after all iterations.

> ***Analogy for future me:*** 
> Imagine this as a tournament bracket where players (threads) compete in pairs. As rounds progress, fewer players remain active until only one winner (final sum) is left.

#### Optimized Thread Assignment *(Convergent Sum Reduction)*

***Changes?***
- Threads are now assigned to consecutive indices instead of even ones:
    - Thread 0 ‚Üí Input, Thread 1 ‚Üí Input[1], Thread 2 ‚Üí Input[2], etc.

- The `stride` starts at half the array size and halves each iteration (`stride /= 2`).

<p><b>Fig 27_02: </b><i> A better assignment of threads to input array locations for reduced control divergence.</i></p>
</div>

***How It Works:***
- In the first iteration:

    - Threads add elements that are halfway across the array.

    - *For example*, **Thread 0** adds `Input` to `Input`, **Thread 1** adds `Input` to `Input[1]`, and so on.

- In subsequent iterations:
    - Remaining active threads add elements closer together as the stride decreases.

- This keeps active threads grouped together within warps, significantly reducing control divergence.

> Results:
> CPU Sum: 157.2

> Mismatch detected! Debugging needed.

> ****Analogy:*** This is like organizing workers on an assembly line. Instead of randomly assigning tasks far apart, workers handle tasks that are closer together, making the process more streamlined and efficient.*

##### TL;DR

| Feature  | Simple Kernel| Optimized Kernel|
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Thread Assignment | Even indices| Consecutive indices|
| Stride Progression| Doubles (`stride *= 2`)| Halves (`stride /= 2`)|
| Control Divergence| High| Reduced |
| Resource Utilization Efficiency| $~35\%$ | $~66\%$ |
